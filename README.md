**13/05/16 Deprecated: this library is no longer maintained. For an alternative solution to this library, Ian Lake from Google recommends using Loaders to persist presenters across configuration changes (https://twitter.com/ianhlake/status/695740092980137984).**

## Overview

Compartment is an extemely lightweight MVP (Model View Presenter) library for Android. It aims to make scoping really easy for Presenters so that each fragment has an associated presenter and that presenter instance doesn't get destroyed on configuration changes. 

## Usage

#### Step 1: 
Make your Activity (or Activities) extend ComponentCacheActivity or build a custom class that implements ComponentCache.

#### Step 2: 
Create a view interface

```
public interface MyView {
  void doSomething();
  void showLoading();
  void hideLoading();
  ...
}
```

#### Step 3: 
Create a presenter that implements `Presenter` or uses the convenience class `BasePresenter`
```
public class MyPresenter extends BasePresenter<MyView> {
  public void someLongTask() {
    view.showLoading();
    
    new AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void>() {
      public Void doInBackground(Void... args) {
        // Simulate some long task
        Thread.sleep(5000);
      }
      
      public void onPostExecute(Void result) {
        view.doSomething();
        view.hideLoading();
      }
    }.execute();
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: 
Create an object to hold a presenter (implements `HasPresenter`)

```
public class MyPresenterComponent implements HasPresenter<MyPresenter> {
  private MyPresenter presenter = new MyPresenter();
  
  @Override MyPresenter getPresenter() {
    return presenter;
  }
}
```

#### Step 5: 
Create a Fragment that extends `PresenterControllerFragment` and implements your view interface. 

```
public class MyFragment extends PresenterControllerFragment<MyPresenterComponent, MyPresenter> implements MyView {
  @Override protected MyPresenterComponent onCreateNonConfigurationComponent() {
    return new MyPresenterComponent();
  }
  ...
}
```

If you made a custom ComponentCache in step 1, you need to override `getComponentCache()` in this Fragment too.

Your fragment now has an associated presenter that you can access using `getPresenter()`. This presenter will survive configuration changes and will have it's lifecycle methods called automatically.

Note that `PresenterControllerFragment` is another convenience class. If you need to extend ListFragment, MapFragment, or any other type of Fragment, you can use the `PresenterControllerDelegate` class and forward all of the events just like `PresenterControllerFragment` does internally. 

## Tips

- This library works well when combined with Dagger 2 as you can use Dagger 2 components for Step 4.
- The components can hold more than just presenters, they could hold any object you want to survive a configuration change. The components can be accessed at any point by calling `getComponent` in the Fragment.
